## ⚙️ Requirements & Installation

### Check if WP-CLI is Available

```bash
# Test if WP-CLI is installed
wp --version

# If you see version output, WP-CLI is available ✓
# If "command not found", see installation below
```

### Installing WP-CLI

#### VPS/Dedicated Server (with SSH root access)

```bash
# Download WP-CLI
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar

# Make executable
chmod +x wp-cli.phar

# Move to system PATH
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

# Verify installation
wp --version
```

#### Shared Hosting (SSH access, no root)

```bash
# Download to home directory
cd ~
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
chmod +x wp-cli.phar

# Create alias in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
echo "alias wp='php ~/wp-cli.phar'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify
wp --version
```

#### Trellis/Bedrock Projects

WP-CLI is pre-installed ✓

### Execution Methods by Hosting Type

Choose the method that matches your hosting environment:

| Hosting Type | WP-CLI | Direct PHP | Browser | Recommended Method |
|--------------|--------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **VPS/Dedicated** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Not recommended | `wp eval-file` |
| **Shared (SSH)** | Install it | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Not recommended | Install WP-CLI or use `php` |
| **Shared (no SSH)** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ⚠️ Last resort | See [Browser Access](#browser-access-last-resort) |
| **Trellis/Bedrock** | ✅ Pre-installed | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Not recommended | `wp eval-file` |
| **cPanel/Plesk** | Maybe | ✅ Via Terminal | ⚠️ Not recommended | See [cPanel/Plesk](#cpanelplesk-terminal) |

### cPanel/Plesk Terminal

Some shared hosts provide browser-based terminals:

**cPanel:**
1. Login → Advanced → Terminal
2. Navigate to WordPress: `cd public_html` (or your WordPress directory)
3. Run scanner:
```bash
php scanner-targeted.php
# Or with full path:
php /home/username/public_html/wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php
```

**Plesk:**
1. Login → File Manager → Open in Terminal (or Tools & Settings → Scheduled Tasks → Terminal)
2. Navigate to WordPress directory
3. Run scanner:
```bash
php scanner-targeted.php
# Or use version-specific PHP binary:
/opt/plesk/php/8.2/bin/php scanner-targeted.php
```

### Browser Access (Last Resort)

⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING**: Only use this method if you have NO other option!

**Setup:**

1. **Upload scanner files** to WordPress root via FTP or File Manager
2. **Add IP whitelist** - Edit the scanner file (e.g., `scanner-targeted.php`) around line 15:

```php
// Find and update this section:
$allowed_ips = [
    '127.0.0.1',
    'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE',  // ← Add your public IP address
];
```

3. **Find your IP address**: Visit https://whatismyipaddress.com/
4. **Access via browser**:
```
https://yoursite.com/scanner-targeted.php
```

5. **CRITICAL - Delete immediately after use**:
```bash
# Via FTP/File Manager, delete:
scanner-targeted.php
scanner-general.php
scanner-wrapper.php
```

**Why browser access is dangerous:**
- ❌ Exposes security scanner to the public internet
- ❌ Could leak file structure and configuration details
- ❌ Scanner file itself could be exploited by attackers
- ❌ Often flagged/blocked by security plugins and WAFs
- ❌ May be logged by server access logs

**Safer alternative for restricted hosting:**

Download your WordPress files via FTP and scan them locally on your computer:

```bash
# On your local machine (after downloading WordPress via FTP)
php scanner-targeted.php /path/to/downloaded-wordpress
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
# From WordPress root directory

# Run both scanners (recommended first scan)
wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-wrapper.php

# Or run individually
wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php  # Quick check (1-2s)
wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-general.php   # Deep scan (2-3s)
```

### Direct PHP Usage

```bash
# If WP-CLI is not available
php wp-cli/security/scanner-wrapper.php
php wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php
php wp-cli/security/scanner-general.php

# Scan specific directory
php wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php /path/to/wordpress
```

## 🔍 Two-Scanner Strategy

### Targeted Scanner (Site-Specific)
**Purpose:** Fast detection of common WordPress vulnerabilities
**Speed:** ~1.7 seconds for 6,600 files

**Detects:**
- Facebook redirect attempts
- File disclosure vulnerabilities
- WordPress-specific exploits (unauthenticated AJAX)
- SQL injection patterns
- PHP malware (eval, base64_decode)
- Code obfuscation

**Use:** Weekly monitoring, post-deployment checks

### General Scanner (Broad Detection)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive malware detection
**Speed:** ~2.5 seconds for 7,400 files

**Detects:**
- Known malware filenames (c99.php, r57.php, shell.php, etc.)
- Pharmaceutical spam injection
- SEO spam and hidden iframes
- Webshell signatures (FilesMan, WSO, etc.)
- Multiple encoding layers
- Backdoor functions
- Long suspicious base64/hex strings

**Use:** Monthly deep scans, after suspected compromise

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Local Development (Bedrock)

```bash
# From Bedrock site directory
wp eval-file wp-ops/wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php
```

### Remote via Trellis

```bash
# SSH into remote server
trellis ssh production

# Navigate to WordPress root
cd /srv/www/example.com/current

# Run scanner (if wp-ops is deployed to server)
wp eval-file /path/to/wp-ops/wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php

# Or copy scanner to server temporarily
scp wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php web@example.com:/tmp/
trellis ssh production -- "cd /srv/www/example.com/current && wp eval-file /tmp/scanner-targeted.php"
```

### Scan Multiple Sites

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# weekly-scan.sh

sites=(
    "/var/www/site1.com"
    "/var/www/site2.com"
    "/var/www/site3.com"
)

for site in "${sites[@]}"; do
    echo "Scanning $site..."
    wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php --path="$site"
done
```

### Recommended Schedule

| Frequency | Scanner | Command |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Weekly** | Targeted | `wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php` |
| **Monthly** | General | `wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-general.php` |
| **After Deployment** | Targeted | `wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php` |
| **After Incident** | Both | `wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-wrapper.php` |

## 🔗 Integration with wp-ops Workflows

### Pre-Deployment Security Check

```bash
# Before pushing database to staging
wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php
ansible-playbook trellis/backup/database-push.yml -e site=example.com -e env=staging
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# After production deployment
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e env=production

# SSH in and scan
trellis ssh production -- "cd /srv/www/example.com/current && \
  wp eval-file /path/to/scanner-targeted.php"
```

### Incident Response Workflow

```bash
# 1. Scan for malware
wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-general.php

# 2. Backup before cleanup (see trellis/backup/)
ansible-playbook trellis/backup/database-backup.yml -e site=example.com -e env=production
ansible-playbook trellis/backup/files-backup.yml -e site=example.com -e env=production

# 3. Clean malware (manual remediation)

# 4. Verify clean
wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php
```

## ⚠️ Security Notes

**IMPORTANT:**
1. **Never commit scanner results** to version control
2. **Delete scanner files from production** after use (if copied temporarily)
3. **Use WP-CLI method** (recommended) instead of browser access
4. **Review output carefully** - not all matches are threats (see false positives)

### Browser Access (Not Recommended)

If you must access via browser:

1. Edit scanner file and add your IP:
```php
$allowed_ips = [
    '127.0.0.1',
    'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE', // Add your IP
];
```

2. Navigate to:
```
https://yoursite.com/wp-cli/security/scanner-wrapper.php
```

3. **DELETE immediately after use!**

## 🎓 Understanding Results

### Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL** - Investigate immediately (malware signatures, backdoors)
- **HIGH** - Review within 24 hours (suspicious redirects, file operations)
- **MEDIUM** - Review as time permits (WordPress exploits, obfuscation)

### Common False Positives

**These are SAFE and can be ignored:**

✅ `xmlrpc.php` - Legitimate WordPress XML-RPC
✅ `wp-includes/rest-api/*` - Legitimate REST API
✅ LiteSpeed Cache files - Legitimate optimization
✅ ACF Pro AJAX - Legitimate frontend functionality
✅ Gravity Forms - Legitimate form handling
✅ SimplePie/MySQL.php - Legitimate library

**See [SCANNER-SUMMARY.md](SCANNER-SUMMARY.md) for complete false positive list**

### Real Threats (Examples)

**Investigate these immediately:**

❌ `c99.php`, `r57.php`, `shell.php` in uploads
❌ `eval(base64_decode(...))` in theme files
❌ `system($_GET['cmd'])` anywhere
❌ Files modified in last 24 hours with suspicious names
❌ New PHP files in `/wp-content/uploads/`

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Automated Cron Job

```bash
# Add to crontab: crontab -e
# Weekly scan every Monday at 3am
0 3 * * 1 /usr/bin/wp eval-file /path/to/wp-ops/wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php --path=/var/www/wordpress > /var/log/wp-scan.log 2>&1
```

### Customization

#### Add Custom Patterns

Edit the scanner file and add your patterns:

```php
// In scanner-targeted.php or scanner-general.php
$patterns = [
    // ... existing patterns ...

    'custom_threat' => [
        'name' => 'My Custom Threat',
        'description' => 'Description of what this detects',
        'patterns' => [
            '/your-regex-pattern-here/i',
        ],
        'severity' => 'CRITICAL',
    ],
];
```

#### Exclude Directories

```php
$config = [
    'exclude_dirs' => [
        'node_modules',
        '.git',
        'vendor',
        'your-custom-dir',  // Add your exclusions
    ],
];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "wp: command not found"

**Cause:** WP-CLI is not installed or not in your system PATH

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Option 1: Install WP-CLI (see Requirements & Installation section)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

# Option 2: Use full path to wp-cli.phar
php ~/wp-cli.phar eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php

# Option 3: Use direct PHP method instead
php wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php
```

### "PHP: command not found" (Shared Hosting)

**Cause:** PHP is not in your PATH or has a different binary name

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Try alternative PHP binary names
/usr/bin/php scanner-targeted.php
/usr/local/bin/php scanner-targeted.php
php-cli scanner-targeted.php
php8.2 scanner-targeted.php  # Version-specific (common on cPanel)

# Find PHP location
which php
whereis php
find /usr -name "php*" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep bin
```

### cPanel/Plesk PHP Version Issues

**cPanel - Select PHP version:**

1. MultiPHP Manager → Select desired PHP version for domain
2. Or use version-specific binary:
```bash
# Check available PHP versions
ls /opt/cpanel/ea-php*/root/usr/bin/php

# Use specific version
/opt/cpanel/ea-php82/root/usr/bin/php scanner-targeted.php
```

**Plesk - Use specific PHP version:**

```bash
# List available PHP versions
ls /opt/plesk/php/

# Use specific version
/opt/plesk/php/8.2/bin/php scanner-targeted.php
```

### File Upload Restrictions

**Problem:** Cannot upload `.php` files via File Manager (security restriction)

**Workaround:**

```bash
# Method 1: Upload as .txt, then rename
1. Upload as: scanner-targeted.txt
2. Rename via File Manager to: scanner-targeted.php

# Method 2: Use FTP instead (usually less restricted than web-based File Manager)
# FTP clients like FileZilla typically allow .php uploads

# Method 3: Upload via SSH/SCP (if available)
scp scanner-targeted.php user@yoursite.com:~/public_html/
```

### Scanner Reports No Files Found

**Cause:** Incorrect path or scanner not in WordPress root

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Method 1: Specify full WordPress path
php scanner-targeted.php /full/path/to/wordpress

# Method 2: Navigate to WordPress root first
cd /var/www/html  # or your WordPress directory
php /path/to/scanner-targeted.php

# Method 3: Use pwd to verify current directory
pwd  # Should show WordPress root with wp-config.php
ls -la wp-config.php  # Verify you're in the right place
```

### Timeout Errors

**Problem:** Scanner times out on large WordPress installations

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Increase PHP timeout
php -d max_execution_time=600 wp-cli/security/scanner-wrapper.php

# Or edit scanner file directly (add at top after <?php):
ini_set('max_execution_time', 600);

# For WP-CLI
wp eval-file scanner-targeted.php --path=/var/www/html --skip-plugins --skip-themes
```

### Memory Errors

**Problem:** PHP runs out of memory

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Increase memory limit
php -d memory_limit=512M wp-cli/security/scanner-wrapper.php

# Or edit scanner file directly (add at top after <?php):
ini_set('memory_limit', '512M');

# Check current memory limit
php -i | grep memory_limit
```

### Permission Errors

**Problem:** Cannot read files or directories

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Method 1: Run as web server user
sudo -u www-data wp eval-file wp-cli/security/scanner-targeted.php

# Method 2: Fix file permissions (carefully!)
# For development only - DO NOT run on production without understanding implications
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# Method 3: Run scanner from a directory you own
cp scanner-targeted.php ~/scanner-targeted.php
php ~/scanner-targeted.php /var/www/html
```

### Browser Access Returns Blank Page

**Cause:** Usually PHP errors being suppressed

**Solutions:**

1. **Check server error logs:**
```bash
# Common log locations
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log  # Apache
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log    # Nginx
tail -f ~/logs/error_log             # cPanel
```

2. **Enable PHP error display** (temporarily, for debugging):
```php
// Add to top of scanner file (after <?php)
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
```

3. **Check if your IP is whitelisted** (see Browser Access section)

4. **Verify PHP file execution is allowed** in that directory

### "Headers already sent" Error

**Cause:** Output or whitespace before PHP opening tag

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check for whitespace/BOM at start of scanner file
hexdump -C scanner-targeted.php | head -n 2

# Should start with: 3c 3f 70 68 70  (which is "<?php")
# If you see: ef bb bf before 3c 3f, that's a UTF-8 BOM - remove it

# Fix with text editor that can save as UTF-8 without BOM
```
